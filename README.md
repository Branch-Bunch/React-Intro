## What is React? ðŸ¤”
- Javascript component-based library for building UIs
- React was built to solve one problem: building large applications with data that changes over time
- ONLY concerns the view layer
- JUST a library, not a framework
- Built by Facebook

## Why use React? ðŸ¤·
- Modular - Build simple components
- Composable - Compose components to build more complex UI
- Reusable - Reuse the components you built
- Flexible - Just a library not a framework
- Learn Once, Write Anywhere - Used with React-Native, could be with Electron
- Dynamic - Content gets updated when necessary

## How to use React? ðŸ“˜
### JSX
- Neither a string nor HTML, it is a syntax extension to JavaScript
- For multiline JSX, wrap it in round braces

```js
const element = <h1>Hello World</h1>
const element = <h1>Execute expressions! {2+2}</h1>

// Under the hood without JSX
// React.createElement(type, [props], [...children])
const element = React.createElement('h1', null, `Hello World`)
const element = React.createElement('h1', null, `Execute expressions! ${2+2}`)
```

### Rendering to DOM
Inside the `index.html`
```html
<div id="root"></div>
```

Inside the `index.js`
```js
const element = <h1>Hello, world</h1>
ReactDOM.render(
  element,
  document.getElementById('root')
)
```

### Componets
- Components are like js functions. They inputs (called "props") and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen
